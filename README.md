# manga-map
A map of settings from my manga. Intended to be viewed while reading the manga. Still a work in progress, more to come.

Notes:
※　High chance of crashing on mobile devices during the first time of opening, will look into ways to prevent this
  ※　Most likely need to convert label images to image sprites
※  Significant delay in switching map modes, likely due to file size of images, will look into ways to prevent this as well
※　Best viewed on PC, needs more optimization all around

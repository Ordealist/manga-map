# manga-map
A map of settings from my manga. Intended to be viewed while reading the manga. Still a work in progress, more to come.<br>
[Link to map of Dragon City](https://ordealist.github.io/manga-map/brongdyu_map.html)<br>
Notes:<br>
※　High chance of crashing on mobile devices during the first time of opening, will look into ways to prevent this<br>
  ※　Most likely need to convert label images to image sprites<br>
※  Significant delay in switching map modes, likely due to file size of images, will look into ways to prevent this as well<br>
※　Best viewed on PC, needs more optimization all around<br>
